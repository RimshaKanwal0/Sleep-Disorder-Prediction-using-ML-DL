## Problem Statement
Sleep disorders like Insomnia and Sleep Apnea significantly impact an individual's physical and mental well-being. Early detection of such conditions can help improve lifestyle interventions, prevent chronic illness, and optimize overall health.

This project aims to develop a machine learning and deep learning-based classification system to predict sleep disorders using features like:

Sleep Duration and Quality
Stress and Physical Activity Levels
Heart Rate, Daily Steps
BMI Category, Occupation, and more
By analyzing patterns in health and lifestyle indicators, we aim to accurately classify whether an individual is likely to suffer from Insomnia or Sleep Apnea.

The goal is to:

Identify key indicators of sleep disorders
Build interpretable and accurate models
Compare multiple ML and DL algorithms
